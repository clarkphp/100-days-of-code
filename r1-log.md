## Log

### R1D2 2020 August 16
**Today's Progress:** Read *create procedure* syntax for [DB2 for i](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_74/db2/rbafzcrtpsf.htm)
and [SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-procedure-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15)
Completed chapter of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying messing about with Rust. Compilers FTW. Still haven't documented the SQL subject matter info; just read documentation.

### R1D2 2020 August 15
**Today's Progress:** Getting back to Rust, after a too-long hiatus. Completed through chapter 2 of *The Rust Programming
Language* book from https://www.rust-lang.org/. Gathered resources for learning Microsoft Transact-SQL.

**Thoughts:** Realized these rounds may not necessarily be "100 days" in length, but rather of whatever duration each project
dictates. The point is to continually and incrementally improve and progress. I'll be spending a *lot of time* learning deeply
along separate dimensions: Rust programming language, DB2 SQL PL, Transact-SQL, and transpilation.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/clarkphp/rustbook (I don't have the other subject matter info documented yet).

### R1D1 2020 August 14
**Today's Progress:** Tailored my 100DaysOfCode fork some more. Learned how to set Git default branch name to "main" instead
of "master," and learned how to rename master branch in existing repositories.

Reviewed what I know about [IBM DB2 for i SQl PL](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_74/db2/rbafzsqlpl.htm),
for stored procedures, functions, DDL, and DML. Read about transpilation, lexers, and parsers.

**Thoughts:** Thorsten Ball's [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) is a good book. Haven't messed
with interpreters much since undergrad school. 32 years ago?!

**Link to work:** What I learned about "main" and "master" branches https://gist.github.com/clarkphp/43561ea739a0a31958c57f259adef2cd

### R1D0 2020 August 13
**Today's Progress:** Prep day before really getting started. Tailored my fork of 100DaysOfCode repository. Thought about
what projects to work on for this and future rounds.

**Thoughts:** I don't have the time to do this, but *I have to something for myself*. The Round 1 project is as good a
platform for learning Rust as any, and the project will be useful for upcoming work on the day job.
